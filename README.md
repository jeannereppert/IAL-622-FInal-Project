# IAL-622-Final-Project
Included in this repository are the two files used to program the arduinos in order to get data from the following sensors:
Light sensor - photoresistor
Air temperature and humidity sensor - Kuman Temperature and Humidity Sensor
Soil temperature sensor - GAOHOU 2 PCS DS18B20 Waterproof Digital Temperature Sensor with Adapter Module for Arduino
Soil moisture sensor - Kuman Soil Moisture Sensor Kit

Two google sheets were created using IFTTT website. These were cleaned with the r program also included.

The resulting file included is named garden_data_final.csv.

Data was then transfered to Power BI for visualization.
